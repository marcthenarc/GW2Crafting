# GW2Crafting
A Guild Wars 2 custom inventory system backend and overlay for managing crafting tasks and objectives.

# Goal
Being somewhat dim-witted when it comes to managing my inventory bags, I tend to hoard stuff, then sell massively, the hoard again, and missing out on upgrading opportunities for my characters.  So it is my wish that this system will automate alerts on specific goals that I fix myself and not be distracted on crafting "lesser" items because, heh, it just looked shiny ... :)

And besides, I like to program stuff. And the GW2 API looked like a cool way to interact with a game I love and support for over 2Â½ years now.

So this backend will serve a twitch overlay which will "advertize" my crafting goals, current status of players, etc. on my stream as I play the game.

# Requirements
This program is written in PHP.  I use Postgresql as a database.  I don't plan to support other databases for the moment although it would be trivial to implement them.  So I'll gladly accept any pull requests if you need to integrate any of them.

# Work in progress
This is a work in progress.  Nothing really "works" for the moment. Consider it pre-alpha.  It's my method to dump stuff early in a repo to avoid deleting / loosing / misplacing stuff as I go along.

# Licence
Read COPYING for my extremely permissive and delicious licence.
